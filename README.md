* Jimmy Chen
* Jimmy Chen, 32, grew up in a Kansas City grew up in a family that had trouble putting food on the table.
* Propel has raised $18.2 Million in 4 Funding Rounds from a total of 14 investors. 
## Business Activities:
* Propel is dedicated to help low income-income Americans improve their finacial help. They created a software, Fresh ETB, a tool that simplifies the management of Food stamp and compensate them with rewards.
* Propel targets the wellfare, low-income market. In the US, as of June 2020 there was an estimated 2,933,544 people on welfare.  The US Government spends about $668 Billion a year on over 120 different welfare programs Nation Wide. 
* Propel conetrates for the moment on the 40 million americans living on food stamps which is a $70 Billion market. Their objective to not disrupt but augmentate the public service offering, they built a strong relationship with the goverment. 
* They are using Python servers Flask and Twisted plus redis, Posgres, Nginx. Develop on Vagrant. using 1 EC2 instance. Deployed by intergrating Ansible and CI with Jenkins (not sure if this last part answers the implementation question) 
## Landscape:
* Propel serves couple of the domains in the financial industry first by developing a Government Entreprise Solution to provide â€¢	Personal Finance / Deposits / Online Banking
* More digitalization and demand for visibility and transparence, is obliging governments to look to Iot to bridge the gap between physical (mainsttream) and Digital. 
* Square and Novo Dia
## Results
* US Governments has been able to save on misused funds, reduce fraud. Users have been able to better manage their benefits by saving with coupons available on the app, find jobs and also innovative ways to earn. 
* As a niche market solution Propel excels in the core metrics, that I found, which are Active Users, Sessions Per User Per Month, Total USD value saved thru the app, Number of Jobs applied for thru thhe app, period of Human time saved by by not call the IVR in Months.  
## Recommendations
* I would suggest, partnership with healthy, organic and eco friendly companies to provide incentives to promote healthy eating and living.
* Added value
* The best part is that this service does not need additional technology
* Because of the nature of the transactions and source of the sensitive data being handled.
